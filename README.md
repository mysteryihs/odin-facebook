# README

My final Ruby on Rails project for theodinproject.com.

Project is a mock up of facebook having users, friends, likes, posts and etc. It includes omniauth which is used as an alternative to create an account by authorizing through facebook.

Uses the following:
* Postgres DB
* Devise
* Facebook Omniauth
* Mailers

Viewable at: https://guarded-bastion-44854.herokuapp.com/

Project isn't styled yet and is barebones mostly because I'm too lazy to pretty it up.
